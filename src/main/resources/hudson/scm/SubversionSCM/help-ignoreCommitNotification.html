<div>
   Ignore changes notified by SCM post-commit hooks (sent at "/subversion/SVN_REPO_UUID/notifyCommit?rev=REV_TO_BUILD"). 
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This can be useful if you want to prevent some long-running jobs (e.g. reports) starting because of every commit, but still want to run them periodic if SCM changes have occurred.
